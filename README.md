Hello!
My name is Shahab Ahmad, a freshie at civil engineering department.
I am very much interested in getting to work as a DevcomCom developer. Before this assignment was announced I had little knowledge about web development. However, my interest didnt let me stop from doing this. Even though I had quizes in this time duration from 16th to 25th January I took out most of the time of the day and last two nights to learn and complete this assignment.
This may not be a perfect website that a freshie is expected to make but this really shows my extreme enthusiasm in learning and working in web development.
JavaScript and CSS were new to me but I managed to gather enough insite so that I am able to make this website.
I hope you will consider these facts while evaluating my performance. A person ready to learn can do anything and I am such a person has been proved by me completing this assignment.

***Some important points to be noted are:
(1)The main page has 4 associated web pages:
i.Achievements
ii.Sports
iii.Programming
iv.Debate

(2)I have used Modernizr, a JavaScript library. This was readymade. I did'n't write it. It detects the availability of various web technologies in a user's browser. Basically making my website more responsive.

(3)The socialLinks.css file has also been taken from outside as it was necessary for importing icons.

(4)Brownie points were announced in assignment for adding a contact section which uses mail.
I have added that section. The HTML and CSS codes are complete. I couldn't make the section work because I had to use a third party service inside JavaScript "mail.js" for enabling mail directly to my account. This required me to Sign in on Mail.js platform which I dont think DevCom wants me to do write now. I have commented the concerned JavaScript code to explain itself.
