    <p>I have played many sports in my life.</p>
    <div id="mygames">
        <div class="cricket">
            <p>The first game I ever played was cricket. My neighbourhood friends used to play with me in the beginning. Later I joined a cricket academy in my city.</p>
            <p>A famous IPL player of KKR team named Rinku Singh belongs to my city, Aligarh.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="badminton">
            <p>Next game that I got interested in was badminton.</p>
            <p>I found it to be a very safe game. There are least chances of getting injured in that game.My parents also advise me to play badminton.</p>
            <p>Recently a friend of mine played badminton in inter IIT championship.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="football">
            <p>Gradually, I also started playing football and got inspired by Messie and Ronaldo like everyone else.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="basketball">
            <p>After some years my school started special training camp for basketball players.I joined that and started playing basketball professionally after 6 months. I played at district level twice and once at state-level championship. </p>
            <p>When I got admitted in IIT Bombay I was made to choose a game to play as a part of curriculum. I obviously chose basketball.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>I play other games on weekends or some other holidays.</p>
